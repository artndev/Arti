There you can find the minimalistic Anki template created using HTML / CSS to feel your studies more comfortable and easier (sometimes)!

## Installation Guide

\* If you want prettier background, you can install the Anki addon called [1210908941](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1210908941). It is used to change the background with a custom image.

We are going to start with moving the _/media_ folder to the absolute path _%appdata%\\Anki2\\User 1\\collection.media_ (Win + R). After that you are ready to make the own Anki template using presets in the _/template_ and _/color_schemes_ folders. Otherwise, you can just import _test.apkg_ with all _template files_ included.

**Don't forget to turn off auto-play in the deck settings!**
