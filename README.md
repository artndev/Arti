There you can find the minimalistic Anki template created using HTML / CSS to feel your studies more comfortable and easier (sometimes)!

## Installation guide

\* If you want a prettier background, you can install the Anki addon called [1210908941](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1210908941). It is used to change the background with a custom image.

There are two options of installation scenario:

1. Move the _/media_ folder to the absolute path _%appdata%\\Anki2\\User 1\\collection.media_ (Win + R). After that you are free to make the own deck using presets in the _/template_ folder.

2. Download the _test.apkg_ deck with a ready-to-go config included.
